Intro
-----------------
If you don't know, I created a python script lately that has the ability to download all of your photos and videos from iCloud Photos.
However, Some files didn't download.
So, I created a python script that can count every single file in a folder (and all the sub-folders)
I made this so I can keep count of how many I downloaded.

-----------------
The python script can be used for any folder, though.
All you do is run the script, choose the folder you want to count files, and it will do it.
It will tell you how many there is and how many of what file type.
